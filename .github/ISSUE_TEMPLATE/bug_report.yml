              ### Before reporting an issue:
              - Set `vscode-neovim.neovimClean` in VSCode settings to confirm if the issue is caused by an Nvim plugin.
              - Read the [documentation](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/) and search [existing issues](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/issues).
              - Usage questions such as ***"How do I...?"*** belong in [Discussions](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/discussions) and will be closed.
              - Plugins that provide their own UI, or work during _insert-mode_, are not supported.
              - Nvim can only interact with one window at a time.
              - Highlights are best-effort.
